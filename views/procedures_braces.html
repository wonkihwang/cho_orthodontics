                                            <p class="text-justify">Many children are ambivalent about getting braces. On the one hand, they like the idea of perfect teeth, but on the other hand they are nervous about whether the braces will cause pain and discomfort. The good news is that the placement of orthodontic braces is not at all painful, and the end result will be a beautiful straight smile.</p>
                                            <p class="text-justify">Although patients of any age can benefit from orthodontic braces, they tend to work much quicker on pre-teens and teenagers since they are still experiencing jaw growth. The American Association of Orthodontists (AAO) recommends that children should first see an orthodontist around the age of seven years-old. An orthodontic examination may be beneficial before age seven if facial or oral irregularities are noted.</p>

                                            <h6>What Causes misalignment of teeth?</h6>
                                            <p class="text-justify">Poorly aligned teeth often cause problems speaking, biting and chewing. Most irregularities are genetic or occur as a result of developmental issues. Conversely, some irregularities are acquired or greatly exacerbated by certain habits and behaviors such as:</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Mouth breathing</li>
                                                <li>Thumb or finger sucking</li>
                                                <li>Prolonged pacifier use</li>
                                                <li>Poor oral hygiene</li>
                                                <li>Poor nutrition</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <br />
                                            <h6>What’s involved when a child gets braces?</h6>
                                            <p class="text-justify">The orthodontist initially conducts a visual examination of the child’s teeth. This will be accompanied by panoramic x-rays, study models (bite impressions) and computer generated images of the head and neck. These preliminary assessments are sometimes known as the “planning phase” because they aid the orthodontist in making a diagnosis and planning the most effective treatment.</p>
                                            <p class="text-justify">In many cases, the orthodontist will recommend “fixed” orthodontic braces for a child. Fixed braces cannot be lost, forgotten or removed at will, which means that treatment is completed more quickly. Removable appliances may also be utilized, which are less intrusive, and are generally used to treat various types of defects.</p>
                                            <p class="text-justify">Here is a brief overview of some of the main types of orthodontic appliances used for children:</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>
                                                    <p class="text-justify"><b class="text-dark">Fixed braces</b> – Braces comprised of brackets which are affixed to each individual tooth, and an archwire which connect the brackets. The brackets are usually made of metal, ceramic, or a clear synthetic material which is less noticeable to the naked eye. After braces have been applied, the child will have regular appointments to have the braces adjusted by the orthodontist. Orthodontic elastic bands are often added to the braces to aid in the movement of specific teeth.</p>
                                                </li>
                                                <li>
                                                    <p class="text-justify"><b class="text-dark">Headgear</b> – This type of appliance is most useful to treat developmental irregularities. A headgear is a custom-made appliance attached to wire that is worn to aid in tooth movement. A headgear is intended to be worn for 12-20 hours r each day and must be worn as recommended to achieve good results.</p>
                                                </li>
                                                <li>
                                                    <p class="text-justify"><b class="text-dark">Retainers</b> – Retainers are typically utilized in the third phase (retention phase). When the original malocclusion has been treated with braces, it is essential that the teeth do not regress back to the original misalignment. Wearing a retainer ensures the teeth maintain their proper alignment, and gives the jawbone around the teeth a chance to stabilize.</p>
                                                </li>
                                            </ul>

                                            <p class="text-justify">Orthodontic braces were historically associated with teenagers. Today, an increasing number of adults are choosing to wear braces to straighten their teeth and correct malocclusions (bad bites). In fact, it is now estimated that almost one third of all current orthodontic patients are adults.</p>
                                            <p class="text-justify">Orthodontic braces are predictable, versatile and incredibly successful at realigning the teeth. Braces work in the same way regardless of the age of the patient, but the treatment time is greatly reduced in patients who are still experiencing jaw growth and have not been affected by gum disease. In short, an adult can experience the same beautiful end results as a teenager, but treatment often takes longer.</p>
                                            <br />
                                            <h6>Can adults benefit from orthodontic braces?</h6>
                                            <p class="text-justify">Absolutely! Crooked or misaligned teeth look unsightly, which in many cases leads to poor self esteem and a lack of self confidence. Aside from poor aesthetics, improperly aligned teeth can also cause difficulties biting, chewing and articulating clearly. Generally speaking, orthodontists agree that straight teeth tend to be healthier teeth.</p>
                                            <p class="text-justify">Straight teeth offer a multitude of health and dental benefits including:</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Reduction in general tooth decay</li>
                                                <li>Decreased likelihood of developing periodontal disease</li>
                                                <li>Decreased likelihood of tooth injury</li>
                                                <li>Reduction in digestive disorders</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <p class="text-justify">Fortunately, orthodontic braces have been adapted and modified to make them more convenient for adults. There are now a wide range of fixed and removable orthodontic devices available, depending on the precise classification of the malocclusion.</p>
                                            <p class="text-justify">The most common types of malocclusion are underbite (lower teeth protrude further than upper teeth), overbite (upper teeth protrude further than lower teeth) and overcrowding, where there is insufficient space on the arches to accommodate the full complement of adult teeth.</p>
                                            <p class="text-justify">Prior to recommending specific orthodontic treatment, the orthodontist will recommend treatment of any pre-existing dental conditions such as gum disease, excess plaque and tooth decay. Orthodontic braces can greatly exacerbate any or all of these conditions.</p>

                                            <h6>What are the main types of orthodontic braces?</h6>
                                            <p class="text-justify">The following are some of the most popular orthodontic braces:</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>
                                                    <p class="text-justify"><b class="text-dark">Traditional braces</b> – These braces are strong and tend not to stain the teeth. They are comprised of individual brackets which are cemented to each tooth and accompanied by an archwire which constantly asserts gentle pressure on the teeth. Traditional braces are generally metal but are also available in a clear synthetic material and “tooth colored” ceramic. The ceramic brackets are generally more comfortable than the metal alternative, but can become discolored by coffee, wine, smoking and certain foods.</p>
                                                </li>
                                                <li>
                                                    <p class="text-justify"><b class="text-dark">Invisalign®</b> – Invisalign aligners are favored by many adults because they are both removable and invisible to onlookers. Invisalign® aligners are clear trays, and should be worn for the recommended amount of time each day for the quickest results. Invisalign® aligners are more comfortable and less obtrusive than traditional braces, but also tend to be more costly. Not all patients are candidates for Invisalign®.</p>

                                            <p class="text-justify">One of the most commonly asked questions about dental braces is whether placing them causes any pain or discomfort. The honest answer is that braces do not hurt at all when they are applied to the teeth, so there is no reason to be anxious. In most cases, there may be mild soreness or discomfort after the orthodontic wire is engaged into the brackets, which may last for a few days.</p>
                                            <p class="text-justify">There are two common types of fixed dental braces used to realign the teeth: Ceramic fixed braces and metal fixed braces. Both types of fixed appliances include brackets which are affixed to each individual tooth, and an archwire the orthodontist fits into the bracket slot to gently move the teeth into proper alignment. Elastic or wire ties will be applied to hold the wire in place. Some orthodontists may use self-ligating brackets which do not require a rubber or wire tie to secure the wire.</p>
                                            <p class="text-justify">Fixed dental braces are used to treat a wide variety of malocclusions, including overbite, underbite, crossbite and overcrowding. If the orthodontist has determined that the malocclusion has been caused by overcrowding, it is possible that teeth may need to be extracted to increase the amount of available space to properly align the teeth.</p>

                                            <h6>What to expect when getting braces</h6>
                                            <p class="text-justify">Here is an overview of what you can expect when getting braces:</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>
                                                    <p class="text-justify"><b class="text-dark">Placement day</b> – The placement of braces will not be painful in the slightest. It may take longer to eat meals, but this is largely because it takes some time to adjust to wearing the braces. In some cases, the teeth may feel more sensitive than usual. Hard, difficult to chew foods should be avoided in favor of a softer, more liquid-based diet for the first few days after placement of braces.</p>
                                                </li>
                                                <li>
                                                    <p class="text-justify"><b class="text-dark">Two days after placement</b> – The first several days after placement of braces can be slightly uncomfortable. This is because the teeth are beginning the realignment process and are not used to the pressure of the archwire and orthodontic elastic bands. The orthodontist will provide relief wax to apply over the braces as necessary. Wax helps provide a smooth surface and alleviates irritation on the inner cheeks and lips. Additionally, over-the-counter pain medication (e.g., Motrin® and Advil®) may be taken as directed to relieve mild soreness.</p>
                                                </li>
                                                <li>
                                                    <p class="text-justify"><b class="text-dark">Five days after placement</b> – After five days, any initial discomfort associated with the braces should be completely gone. The teeth will have gradually acclimated to the braces, and eating should be much easier. Certain hard foods may still pose a challenge to the wearer, but normal eating may be resumed at this point.</p>
                                                </li>
                                                <li>
                                                    <p class="text-justify"><b class="text-dark">Orthodontic appointments</b> – Regular orthodontic appointments are necessary to allow the orthodontist to change the archwire, change the rubber or metal ties, and make adjustments to the braces. Fixed braces work by gradually moving the teeth into a new and proper alignment, so gentle pressure needs to be applied constantly. The first several days after an orthodontic adjustment may be slightly uncomfortable, but remember that this discomfort will quickly fade.</p>
                                                </li>
                                                <li>
                                                    <p class="text-justify"><b class="text-dark">Dealing with discomfort</b> – Over-the-counter pain medication and orthodontic relief wax will help alleviate any mild soreness and discomfort following placement o braces and orthodontic adjustments. Another effective remedy is to chew sugar-free gum, as this increases blood flow which helps reduces discomfort and can also encourage the teeth to align quicker.</p>
                                                </li>
