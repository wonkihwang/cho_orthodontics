You will be able to discuss fees and payment options before treatment begins. Our staff will discuss with you the cost of your treatment and each available payment plan option, so that you can make the best choice for your children or your smile. We will work with you to create a payment plan that fits your budget, and you will know what to expect before beginning of the treatment. We work hard to make orthodontics affordable.</p>

                                    If you have insurance that will be covering any portion of your orthodontic treatment, our office staff is always available to help you with insurance claims and paperwork.
                                    <br />At your free consultation, we will plan to do a complimentary insurance benefits check in order to make sure you are maximizing your insurance benefits for orthodontic treatment. All of this will be done free of charge so you can make a decision without any type of financial commitment.
                                    <br />Professional care is provided to you, our patient, and not to an insurance company. Thus, the insurance company is responsible to the patient and the patient is responsible to the doctor. We will help in every way we can in filing your claim and handling insurance questions from our office on your behalf. Our accounting staff will prepare all the necessary forms for your dental benefits. However, we remind you that your specific policy is an agreement between you and your insurance company. Please keep in mind that you are responsible for your total obligation should your insurance benefits result in less coverage than anticipated. Our staff will gladly submit a pre-treatment estimate to your insurance company so that you will know what your benefits will be.
                                    <br />Please let us know if you have any questions about your insurance coverage or ideas about how we can make your entire orthodontic experience a pleasant one.
                                    <br />Please let us know if you have any questions about your insurance coverage or payment options; and let us know how we can help to make your entire orthodontic experience a pleasant one.

                                                A: Straighter teeth perform chewing, biting, and speaking functions more effectively than crooked teeth. In addition, a straight smile boosts confidence, is aesthetically pleasing to look at, and can help stave off a wide variety of dental ailments.
                                                <br /><br />There are several types of malocclusion including overbite, underbite, crossbite, and overcrowding. Each of these alignment problems negatively impacts the functionality and cosmetic appearance of the teeth.
                                                <br /><br />Here is a brief overview of some of the main disorders associated with crooked teeth:
                                                <br /><br /><b style="font-weight:600;color:#fff;background-color:#1ecec8;padding:0 10px;">Periodontitis</b> – Periodontitis or gum disease begins with a bacterial infection. The bacterial infection is caused by inadequate oral hygiene. Crooked teeth are hard to effectively clean, which means that debris, plaque, and bacteria can build up in hard-to-reach areas. Straight teeth are much easier to clean and are at less risk of contracting gum disease.
                                                <br /><br /><b style="font-weight:600;color:#fff;background-color:#1ecec8;padding:0 10px;">Temporomandibular Disorder (TMJ)</b> - Crooked teeth can lead to improper jaw alignment, which in turn causes a painful condition known as TMJ. Severe headaches, jaw pain, lockjaw, and grinding of teeth characterize this debilitating disorder.
                                                <br /><br /><b style="font-weight:600;color:#fff;background-color:#1ecec8;padding:0 10px;">Tooth injury</b> – Straight teeth create a strong wall, which means injuries are less likely to occur. Crooked teeth are weaker and often protrude, making them far more vulnerable to external injury.
                                                <br /><br /><b style="font-weight:600;color:#fff;background-color:#1ecec8;padding:0 10px;">Uneven wear</b> – Crooked teeth cause some of the teeth to work harder than others when biting and chewing. Straight teeth share the workload evenly, meaning less risk of injury and better aesthetics.
                                                <br /><br />Teeth can be straightened using either orthodontic braces or customized aligning trays. Orthodontic braces are usually affixed to the teeth for a set duration. The brackets and archwires are tightened regularly by the orthodontist and removed when treatment is complete. Fixed braces can be placed on the front side or back side of the teeth and are effective for most types of malocclusion.
                                                <br /><br />Aligning trays are fully removable and are used where the malocclusion is less severe, and the teeth need to move a shorter distance. These trays are replaced every few weeks for the duration of the treatment, and have proven to be equally effective for straightening teeth.
                                                <br /><br />If you have questions about orthodontics and straightening teeth, please contact our office.

Orthodontists will focus all efforts of continuing education only within the specialty of orthodontics, ensuring that you are receiving the best and most specialized care possible.

This will allow us to assess the eruption pattern of teeth, and prevent, intercept, or correct any problems that may become more serious if left untreated at an early age. There are a number of indications for early orthodontic treatment, but the majority of young patients will simply be placed on a recall program in order to continue monitoring the eruption of their permanent teeth.

                                                A: Clear aligners are becoming a very popular treatment for teens and adults. Invisalign is a series of clear aligners that gradually straightens your teeth over time without the need for traditional metal braces. At your free initial examination we will let you know if you are a candidate for Invisalign. Most people are excellent candidates and we will have no problems. In the cases where we feel Invisalign may not be able to achieve the results you are looking for in a timely fashion, we will give our professional recommendations for what other types of esthetic treatment options would produce the best result. Regardless, our goal is to meet your needs.
