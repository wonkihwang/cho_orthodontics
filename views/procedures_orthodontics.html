                            Orthodontics is a branch of dentistry specializing in the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of jaw, face and bite irregularities (malocclusions*). Orthodontic treatment is provided by an oral health care provider known as an Orthodontist, who has typically completed two to three years of additional training beyond dental school.

                            Recent years have brought about many changes within the dental industry, specifically with regards to orthodontic treatment and care. Now more than ever patients are experiencing fewer incidences of cavities and missing teeth due to the heightened awareness of fluoride use and preventative dentistry. This increasing awareness on the health and look of a patient’s smile has fueled the desire for many to seek out orthodontia not only as a medical necessity, but for cosmetic reasons as well.

                            * <b>Malocclusion</b> is the technical term for teeth that don’t fit together correctly. Malocclusions not only affect the teeth, but also the appearance of the face. Most malocclusions are inherited; however some are due to acquired habits such as thumb sucking and tongue thrusting. The spacing left from an adult tooth being extracted or an early loss of a baby tooth can also contribute to a malocclusion.

                                            <p class="text-justify">Orthodontics is one of many dental specialties. The word “orthodontics” is derived from the Greek words orthos, meaning proper or straight and odons meaning teeth. Orthodontics is specifically concerned with diagnosing and treating tooth misalignment and irregularity in the jaw area. Initially, orthodontic treatments were geared toward the treatment of teens and pre-teens, but these days around 30 percent of orthodontic patients are adults.</p>
                                            <p class="text-justify">There are many advantages to well-aligned teeth, including easier cleaning, better oral hygiene, clearer speech and a more pleasant smile. Though orthodontic treatment can be effective at any age, the American Dental Association suggests that an orthodontic assessment should be performed around the age of seven. The earlier orthodontic treatment begins, the more quickly the problem can be successfully resolved.</p>

                                                Orthodontics is a versatile branch of dentistry that can be used alone, or in combination with maxillofacial or cosmetic dentistry.
                                                <br />Here are some of the common conditions treated with orthodontics:

An example of such a discrepancy would be an overbite (where the upper teeth are further forward than the lower teeth), or an underbite (where the lower teeth are further forward then the upper teeth).</p>

                                                Orthodontics is a technologically advanced field which offers many sophisticated solutions to malocclusions and other cosmetic problems. The orthodontist will generally perform a visual examination, panoramic x-rays and study models (bite impressions) in order to assess the exact nature of the discrepancy.
                                                <br />When a diagnosis has been made, there are a variety of orthodontic treatment options available.

The orthodontist is able to gradually train the teeth into proper alignment by regularly adjusting the wire. When the desired results are achieved, the fixed dental braces are completely removed.</p>

                                            <p class="text-justify">In much the same way as doctors choose to specialize in areas such as cardiology and neurology, dentists can also choose to specialize. Orthodontics is a dental specialty which aims to prevent, diagnose and treat facial and dental irregularities, such as malocclusions (bad bites). Many orthodontic practices are limited to dentofacial orthopedics and general orthodontics but can successfully treat patients of any age.</p>
                                            <p class="text-justify">Orthodontists are fully qualified dentists who embark on a further three years of university-based study and gain extensive clinical experience in an orthodontic residency program. The American Association of Orthodontists (AAO) is the regulating body for this branch of dentistry. Selecting an orthodontist who is a member of this organization adds the assurance that treatment is being administered by an individual with specialty education in oral biology and biomechanics. The AAO recommends that children should first be examined by the orthodontist around the age of seven, to ensure that jaw and tooth irregularities are not beginning to form.</p>

                                            <h6>What does an orthodontist do?</h6>
                                            <p class="text-justify">
                                                Orthodontists are experts in correcting misalignments of the teeth and jaw. There are many debilitating problems associated with misalignment, for example, speech defects, difficulties chewing and difficulty maintaining adequate oral hygiene.
                                                <br />Here is a brief overview of some of the most common issues an orthodontist can successfully treat:
                                            </p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>
                                                    <p class="text-justify"><b class="text-dark">Anteroposterior deviations</b> – Common examples of anteroposterior deviations include underbite (the lower teeth are positioned further forward than upper teeth) and overbite (the upper teeth are positioned further forward than the lower teeth). Both of these deviations can cause difficulty articulating and chewing.</p>
                                                </li>
                                                <li>
                                                    <p class="text-justify"><b class="text-dark">Overcrowding</b> – Overcrowding is one of the most common problems orthodontists treat. On occasion, lack of jawbone space means adult teeth cannot erupt in alignment with existing teeth. The orthodontist is able to realign the teeth using a number of unobtrusive devices and treatments.
                                                </li>
                                                </p>
                                                <li>
                                                    <p class="text-justify"><b class="text-dark">Aesthetic issues</b> – In some cases, the shape of the whole face is negatively impacted by malocclusions or a bad bite. The orthodontist can restructure and realign the jaw, lips and teeth to create a beautiful, even smile.
                                                </li>
                                                </p>
                                            </ul>
                                            <br />
                                            <h6>How does an orthodontist realign jaws and teeth?</h6>
                                            <p class="text-justify">
                                                Initially, the orthodontist conducts a thorough examination of the jaw and teeth. Panoramic x-rays and study models (bite impressions) will be taken prior to the orthodontist making treatment recommendations. The orthodontist will recommend the best treatment plan for the patient’s particular condition.
                                                <br />Here is a brief overview of some of the treatments orthodontists may use:
                                            </p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>
                                                    <p class="text-justify"><b class="text-dark">Dental braces</b> – The combination of brackets (which are affixed to each individual tooth), and an archwire (which connects each bracket) are commonly placed to gently train the teeth into proper alignment. Dental braces can be made of metal, ceramics or clear (“invisible”) materials.</p>
                                                </li>
                                                <li>
                                                    <p class="text-justify"><b class="text-dark">Headgear and facemasks</b> – These devices are generally used to correct a developmental problem, such as an overbite or an underbite. In addition to the dental braces, the orthodontist will design the headgear and/or facemask which fit around the head and attaches to the braces. This structure will further encourage the teeth and jawbone into alignment.</p>
                                                </li>
                                                <li>
                                                    <p class="text-justify"><b class="text-dark">Retainers</b> – After the orthodontist has realigned the teeth using dental braces, removable devices or a headgear, a retainer may then be provided to ensure that the teeth do not begin to move back toward their original positions. Retainers are generally worn until the underlying bone has reformed into the correct position.</p>
                                                </li>
                                            </ul>

In addition, a straight smile boosts confidence, is aesthetically pleasing to look at, and can help stave off a wide variety of dental ailments.</p>
                                            <p class="text-justify">There are several types of malocclusion including overbite, underbite, crossbite, and overcrowding. Each of these alignment problems negatively impacts the functionality and cosmetic appearance of the teeth.</p>
                                            <p class="text-justify">Here is a brief overview of some of the main disorders associated with crooked teeth:</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>
                                                    <p class="text-justify"><b class="text-dark">Periodontitis</b> – Periodontitis or gum disease begins with a bacterial infection. The bacterial infection is caused by inadequate oral hygiene. Crooked teeth are hard to clean effectively, which means that debris, plaque and bacteria can build up in hard-to-reach areas. Straight teeth are much easier to clean and are at less risk of contracting gum disease.</p>
                                                </li>
                                                <li>

Severe headaches, jaw pain, lockjaw and the grinding of teeth characterize this debilitating disorder.</p>
                                                </li>
                                                <li>

Crooked teeth are weaker and often protrude, making them far more vulnerable to external injury.</p>
                                                </li>

Straight teeth share the workload evenly, meaning less risk of injury and better aesthetics.</p>
                                                </li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <p class="text-justify">Teeth can be straightened using either orthodontic braces or customized aligning trays. Orthodontic braces are usually affixed to the teeth for a set duration. The brackets and archwires are tightened regularly by the orthodontist and removed when treatment is complete. Fixed braces can be placed on the front side or back side of the teeth and are effective for most types of malocclusion.</p>
                                            <p class="text-justify">Aligning trays are fully removable and are used where the malocclusion is less severe, and the teeth need to move a shorter distance. These trays are replaced every few weeks for the duration of the treatment, and have proven to be equally effective for straightening teeth.</p>

                                            <p class="text-justify">A malocclusion is an incorrect relationship between the maxilla (upper arch) and the mandible (lower arch), or a general misalignment of the teeth. Malocclusions are so common that most individuals experience one, to some degree. The poor alignment of the teeth is thought to be a result of genetic factors combined with poor oral habits, or other factors in the early years.</p>
                                            <p class="text-justify">Moderate malocclusion commonly requires treatment by an orthodontist. Orthodontists are dentists who specialize in the treatment of malocclusions and other facial irregularities.</p>
                                            <p class="text-justify">The following are three main classifications of malocclusion:</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>

This can be caused by the protrusion of anterior teeth or the overlapping of the central teeth by the lateral teeth.</p>
                                                </li>

An underbite usually occurs when the jawbone is large or the maxillary bone is short.</p>
                                                </li>

                                            <h6>Reasons for treating a malocclusion</h6>
                                            <p class="text-justify">A severe malocclusion may lead to skeletal disharmony of the lower face. In a more extreme case, the orthodontist may work in combination with a maxillofacial dentist to reconstruct the jaw. It is never too late to seek treatment for a malocclusion. Children and adults alike have completed orthodontic realignment procedures and have been delighted with the resulting even, straight smile.</p>
                                            <p class="text-justify">Here are some of the main reasons to seek orthodontic treatment for a malocclusion:</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>
                                                    <p class="text-justify"><b class="text-dark">Reduced risk of tooth decay</b> – A malocclusion often causes an uneven wear pattern on the teeth. The constant wearing of the same teeth can lead to tooth erosion and decay.</p>
                                                </li>
                                                <li>
                                                    <p class="text-justify"><b class="text-dark">Better oral hygiene</b> – A malocclusion can be caused by overcrowding. When too many teeth are competing for too little space, it can be difficult to clean the teeth and gums effectively. It is much easier to clean straight teeth that are properly aligned.</p>
                                                </li>
                                                <li>
                                                    <p class="text-justify"><b class="text-dark">Reduced risk of TMJ</b> – Temporomandibular jaw syndrome (TMJ) is thought to be caused by a malocclusion. Headaches, facial pains and grinding teeth during sleep all result from the excessive pressure to the temporomandibular joint. Realigning the teeth reduces pressure, and eliminates these symptoms.</p>

                                            <h6>How is a malocclusion treated?</h6>
                                            <p class="text-justify">A malocclusion is usually treated with dental braces. The orthodontist takes panoramic x-rays, conducts visual examinations and bite impressions of the whole mouth before deciding on the best course of treatment. If a malocclusion is obviously caused by overcrowding, the orthodontist may decide an extraction is the only way to create enough space for the realignment. However, in the case of an underbite, crossbite or overbite, there are several different orthodontic appliances available, such as:</p>

The orthodontist adjusts or changes the wire on a regular basis to train the teeth into proper alignment.</p>
                                                </li>

Retainers, headgear and palate expanders are amongst the most common. Retainers are generally used to hold the teeth in the correct position whilst the jawbone grows properly around them.</p>

                                            <p class="text-justify">The benefits of orthodontic treatment often go beyond the obvious physical changes of an improved bite and straighter teeth; it’s also a great way to improve a person’s overall self-image. While having beautiful straight teeth is important, even more important is the need to alleviate any potential health problems associated with the teeth or jaw. Crooked teeth or jaw problems may contribute to improper cleaning of teeth, leading to tooth decay and, possibly, gum disease or total tooth loss. Orthodontic problems that go untreated can lead to chewing and digestion difficulties, speech impairments, and abnormal wear of tooth surfaces. Over time, excessive strain on gum tissue and the bone that supports the teeth can affect the jaw joints leading to problems such as headaches or face and neck pain.</p>
                                            <p class="text-justify">The <b class="text-dark">American Association of Orthodontics</b> recommends that children get an orthodontic evaluation no later than age 7. Though orthodontic treatment can be done at any age, timely treatment ensures maximum dental health.</p>
                                            <p class="text-justify">With all of the recent advancements in orthodontics, wearing braces has never been easier. State-of-the-art appliances and treatments are now available, from traditional metal braces, to clear and tooth colored brackets, to NASA type wires that are heat activated and require fewer adjustments! Some patients may even be candidates for treatment with Invisalign, a revolutionary way to straighten teeth using clear, retainer type aligners that require no braces or wires!</p>
